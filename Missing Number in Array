LeetCode 268. Missing Number (Easy)
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 3:
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation:
n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

class Main{

        int total = n * (n + 1)/ 2;

        for(int i=0; i<=arr.length-1; i++){
            result += arr[i];
        }
        return total - result;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int arr[] = {9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1};
        System.out.println(missing(arr));
    }

GFG Missing in Array
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 29.59%Submissions: 1.6MPoints: 2Average Time: 15m
You are given an array arr[] of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Your task is to identify and return the missing element.
Examples
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.
Input: arr[] = [8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 8 are present except 6.
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Only 1 is present so the missing element is 2.

import java.util.*;
class Main{
    public static int missing(int arr[]){
        int n = arr.length+1;  // in GFG this Condition is must +1 because 1 to n 
        int total = n * (n + 1)/ 2;
        int result=0;
        for(int i=0; i<=arr.length-1; i++){
            result += arr[i];
        }
        return total - result;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int arr[] = {9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1};
        System.out.println(missing(arr));
    }
}

// to pass all test cases of GFG then use this Approch where if have to Just use Long variable
class Solution {
    int missingNum(int arr[]) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.length + 1;
        long total = (long) n * (n + 1)/ 2;
        long result=0;
        for(int i=0; i<=arr.length-1; i++){
            result += arr[i];
        }
        return (int)(total - result);
    }
}
