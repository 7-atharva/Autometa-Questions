Sort 0s, 1s and 2s (GFG)
Difficulty: Medium
Given an array arr[] containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Sort the array in ascending order.
Note: You need to solve this problem without utilizing the built-in sort function.
Examples:

Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.

75. Sort Colors (Medium)
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

Optimal Solution
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
    }
}

Best Solution using Algorithm called Dutch National Flag Algo
class Solution {
    public void swap(int arr[], int i, int j){
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
    public void sort012(int[] arr) {
        // code here with OPTIMAL solution 
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        // Best Solution 
        
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length-1;
        int index = 0;
        
        for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
            if(arr[index] == 0){
                swap(arr, index, start);
                index++;
                start++;
            } else if(arr[index] == 2){
                swap(arr, index, end);
                end --;
            }else{
                index++;
            }
        }
    }
}
