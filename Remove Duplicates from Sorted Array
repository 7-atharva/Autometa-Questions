26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (Easy LeetCode)
Hint
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
Consider the number of unique elements in nums to be k​​​​​​​​​​​​​​. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements k.

The first k elements of nums should contain the unique numbers in sorted order. The remaining elements beyond index k - 1 can be ignored.

Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation
assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).


# For solving this question there are 2 Approch 
1. Normal
2. HashSet (Which does not contains Duplicate elements)

1. Normal Approch 
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<nums.length; i++){
            if(i<nums.length-1 && nums[i] == nums[i+1]){
                continue;
            }else{
                nums[count] = nums[i];
                count ++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

✅ What is a HashSet? HashSet is a data structure in Java that stores unique elements and provides constant time performance for add, remove, and search operations using hashing.
2. Hashset Approch TC and SC : O(n)
import java.util.*;
class Main {
    public static int removedup(int nums[]){
        HashSet<Integer> hs = new HashSet<>();
        int count = 0;
        for(int i:nums){
            if(!hs.contains(i)){
                hs.add(i);
                nums[count] = i;
                count ++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // int arr[] = {1,1,2};  // 2     nums = [1,2,_]
        int arr[] = {0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4};  // 5  nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
        
        System.out.println(removedup(arr));
    }
}
✅ What is a HashSet? HashSet is a data structure in Java that stores unique elements and provides constant time performance for add, remove, and search operations using hashing.
A HashSet in Java is a collection that:
✔ Stores unique elements only (no duplicates)
✔ Does not maintain order
✔ Uses a hashing mechanism internally
✔ Provides fast operations — add, remove, search in O(1) average time
HashSet include in this package : import java.util.HashSet;

❓ Why Do We Use HashSet?
🔹 1. To Remove Duplicates
Because it automatically ignores duplicate values

HashSet<Integer> hs = new HashSet<>();
hs.add(1);
hs.add(1);
System.out.println(hs); // [1]

🔹 2. Fast Searching
Instead of looping through an array (O(n)), HashSet checks in O(1) time.

🔹 3. When Order Doesn’t Matter
If we only care about unique elements and speed, HashSet is perfect.
