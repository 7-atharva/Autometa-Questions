GFG Equilibrium Point (Easy)
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 28.13%Submissions: 674K+Points: 2Average Time: 15m
Given an array of integers arr[], the task is to find the first equilibrium point in the array.
The equilibrium point in an array is an index (0-based indexing) such that the sum of all elements before that index is the same as the sum of elements after it. Return -1 if no such point exists. 

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 3]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The sum of left of index 2 is 1 + 2 = 3 and sum on right of index 2 is 3.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no equilibrium index in the array.
Input: arr[] = [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sum of left of index 3 is -7 + 1 + 5 = -1 and sum on right of index 3 is -4 + 3 + 0 = -1.

import java.util.*;
class Main {
    public static int midsum(int arr[]){
        int totalsum=0;
        for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
            totalsum += arr[i];
        }
        int leftsum=0;
        for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
            totalsum -= arr[i]; // this is the rightsum where this formula used totalsum - leftsum - arr[i];
            if(leftsum == totalsum){
                return i;
            }
            leftsum += arr[i];
        }
        return -1;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int arr[] = {4,2,1,7,5,1,1};
        System.out.println(midsum(arr));
    }
}
op = 3 as index start from 0 index so, 0,1,2,3 = 7
Dry run of code 

The logic of my code in a simple way, especially how the left sum and right sum are calculated and compared to find the required index.
Basic Idea of the Logic:
The goal is to check, for each index in the array, whether:
* the sum of elements on the left side of that index
  is equal to
* the sum of elements on the right side of that index.
If both sums are equal, then that index is the required answer.

so instead of creating an rightsum i directly done this totalsum -= arr[i] means rightsum 

How the Logic Works :
1. First, I calculate the total sum of all elements in the array.
2. I create a variable leftsum and initialize it to 0.
3. I then loop through the array from left to right.
4. At each index:
   *I subtract the current element from totalsum.
     After this subtraction totalsum represents the right side sum.
   *I compare leftsum and totalsum.
   *If both are equal i print the current index.
   *after the comparison i add the current element to leftsum so it is ready for the next index.
The current element is not included in either left or right sum during the comparison.
for the code this is Dry Run Example:
Array:
{4, 1, 2, 7, 5, 1, 1}
Initial values: totalsum = 21
leftsum = 0

Index 0
totalsum = 21 − 4 = 17
leftsum = 0
0 ≠ 17 → not a match
leftsum becomes 4

Index 1
totalsum = 17 − 1 = 16
leftsum = 4
4 ≠ 16 → not a match
leftsum becomes 5

Index 2
totalsum = 16 − 2 = 14
leftsum = 5
5 ≠ 14 → not a match
leftsum becomes 7

Index 3
totalsum = 14 − 7 = 7
leftsum = 7
7 = 7 → match found
So, index 3 is printed as the answer.

Final Understanding :
 leftsum stores the sum of elements on the left side.
 totalsum stores the sum of elements on the right side. sry sir actually i'm getting confused in this step;
If both sums are the same the index we are checking is the required index.
